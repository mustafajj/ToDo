This is a Todo App

This project was developed using Spring Boot.
This project was hooked up by MongoDB.

We created a document (equivalent to model) called Todo having and ID and a Text.

We created a repository which will help us add our changes to MongoDB, and specified our Integer Primary Key

We created a resource (equivalent to controller) to perform our API Calls.

All of our calls start with /api

We created the following functions:
-Get a list of all Todos
-Get a Todo based on its Primary Key
-Create a Todo
-Delete a Todo
